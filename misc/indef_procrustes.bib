	abstract = {A generalisation of a latent position network model known as the random dot product graph model is considered. The resulting model may be of independent interest because it has the unique property of representing a mixture of connectivity behaviours as the corresponding convex combination in latent space. We show that, whether the normalised Laplacian or adjacency matrix is used, the vector representations of nodes obtained by spectral embedding provide strongly consistent latent position estimates with asymptotically Gaussian error. Direct methodological consequences follow from the observation that the well-known mixed membership and standard stochastic block models are special cases where the latent positions live respectively inside or on the vertices of a simplex. Estimation via spectral embedding can therefore be achieved by respectively estimating this simplicial support, or fitting a Gaussian mixture model. In the latter case, the use of \$K\$-means, as has been previously recommended, is suboptimal and for identifiability reasons unsound. Empirical improvements in link prediction, as well as the potential to uncover much richer latent structure (than available under the mixed membership or standard stochastic block models) are demonstrated in a cyber-security example.},

In this work we develop a new parameterization for general exchangeable random graphs, where the nodes are independent random vectors in a linear space equipped with an indefinite inner product, and the edge probability between two nodes equals the inner product of the corresponding node vectors. Therefore, the distribution of exchangeable random graphs can be represented by a node sampling distribution on this linear space, which we call the "graph root distribution". We study existence and uniqueness of such representations, the topological relationship between the graph root distribution and the exchangeable random graph sampling distribution, and the statistical estimation of graph root distributions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0600},
	abstract = {Consider any random graph model where potential edges appear independently, with possibly different probabilities, and assume that the minimum expected degree is omega(ln n). We prove that the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian of that random graph are concentrated around the corresponding matrices of the weighted graph whose edge weights are the probabilities in the random model. While this may seem surprising, we will see that this matrix concentration phenomenon is a generalization of known results about the Er{\textbackslash}"\{o\}s-R{\textbackslash}'\{e\}nyi model. In particular, we will argue that matrix concentration is implicit the theory of quasi-random graph properties. We present two main applications of the main result. In bond percolation over a graph G, we show that the Laplacian of the random subgraph is typically very close to the Laplacian of G. As a corollary, we improve upon a bound for the spectral gap due to Chung and Horn that was derived via much more complicated methods. In inhomogeneous random graphs, there are points X\_1,...,X\_n uniformly distributed on the interval [0,1] and each pair is connected with probability p kappa(X\_i,X\_j). We show that if {\textbackslash}ln n/n{\textless}{\textless} p{\textless}{\textless} 1 and kappa is bounded, then the adjacency matrix of the random graph is close to an integral operator defined in terms of kappa. Our main proof tool is a new concentration inequality for matrix martingales that generalizes Freedman's inequality for the standard scalar setting.},

Myriad applications including clustering, classification, and dimensionality reduction involve studying and exploiting the geometric structure of singular values and singular vectors. This paper provides a novel collection of technical and theoretical tools for studying the geometry of singular subspaces using the two-to-infinity norm. Motivated by preliminary deterministic Procrustes analysis, we consider a general matrix perturbation setting in which we derive a new Procrustean matrix decomposition. Together with flexible machinery developed for the two-to-infinity norm, this allows us to conduct a refined analysis of the induced perturbation geometry with respect to the underlying singular vectors even in the presence of singular value multiplicity. Our analysis yields singular vector entrywise perturbation bounds for a range of popular matrix noise models, each of which has a meaningful associated statistical inference task. In addition, we demonstrate how the two-to-infinity norm is the preferred norm in certain statistical settings. Specific applications discussed in this paper include covariance estimation, singular subspace recovery, and multiple graph inference. Both our Procrustean matrix decomposition and the technical machinery developed for the two-to-infinity norm may be of independent interest.},

We examine the analogues, in graph inference, of several canonical tenets of classical Euclidean inference: in particular, we summarize a body of existing results on the consistency and asymptotic normality of the adjacency and Laplacian spectral embeddings, and the role these spectral embeddings can play in the construction of single- and multi-sample hypothesis tests for graph data. We investigate several real-world applications, including community detection and classification in large social networks and the determination of functional and biologically relevant network properties from an exploratory data analysis of the Drosophila connectome.

In this paper, we derive a generic \${\textbackslash}ell\_\{2{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ eigenspace perturbation bound for symmetric random matrices, with independent or dependent entries and fairly flexible entry distributions. In particular, we apply our generic bound to binary random matrices with independent entries or with certain dependency structures, including the unnormalized Laplacian of inhomogenous random graphs and \$m\$-dependent matrices. Through a detailed comparison, we found that for binary random matrices with independent entries, our \${\textbackslash}ell\_\{2{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ bound is tighter than all existing bounds that we are aware of, while our condition is weaker than most of them with only one exception in a special regime. We employ our perturbation bounds in three problems and improve the state of the art: concentration of the spectral norm of sparse random graphs, exact recovery of communities in stochastic block models and partial consistency of divisive hierarchical clustering. Finally we discuss the extensions of our theory to random matrices with more complex dependency structures and non-binary entries, asymmetric rectangular matrices and induced perturbation theory in other metrics.},

To address this question we propose a statistical model for graph/class pairs. This model naturally leads to a set of estimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or "signal-subgraph," defined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between the classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal and efficient, but differ by their assumption about the "coherency" of the signal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges "stick together" around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best estimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but also the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a contemporary neuroscience question: can we classify "connectomes" (brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better than all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates that even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of training samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of salt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions.},
